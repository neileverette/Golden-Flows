### We’ve all been there...

A new project lands in your lap—big, ambitious, and fuzzy around the edges. It’s early, Day 0. Maybe there are “requirements,” maybe just a rough idea, or maybe it’s literally a pile of notes someone typed during a meeting.

The technical space feels dense, maybe even cryptic. Nothing quite clicks yet, and you’re trying to piece together enough understanding to form a mental model. On top of that, the team may not see the same picture, or it’s difficult for you to even see the picture. Or worse yet, team members disagree and have competing objectives. And you’re the one in the middle—expected to move things forward while everyone looks to you for clarity.

**Sounds familiar, right? Yeah… same here.**

The natural instinct is to open Figma and start mocking things up. Or open Aha and start writing functional requirements. If you’re a designer, maybe you hunt down old mockups or jump straight into the Carbon library to assemble new screens. It feels productive—almost obligatory.

But at this stage, it’s the wrong move. Those tools can actually increase confusion or lock you into a direction before anyone even agrees on what problem you’re solving.

----------

**This is the moment where your role shifts.**  

You stop thinking like a _UI_ designer and step into the mindset of a _product_ designer. And yeah—the difference is huge. UI design is about the screen. Product design is about the **story**: the user, the goal, the task, the business need, the technical constraints, and how it all pieces together into one coherent narrative.

In these early moments, your work becomes broader and more strategic. It’s less about components and more about **visual thinking**, **sense-making**, and **mapping the problem space**. You’re working with your triad—design, product, and engineering—to align on the user, the job they’re trying to get done, and the major building blocks required to support that journey.

Your job here is to sketch the high-level shape of the experience—not the UI, but the _structure_ of the solution. You’re creating just enough clarity so everyone can point to the same thing and say, “Yeah—that’s what we’re building.” Once that alignment exists, then the detailed requirements and screens actually have something solid underneath them.

### Fidelity should match the understanding.

Ok Neil… what does that even mean?  

It means **don’t start in high fidelity**. That's solutioning. Don’t jump straight into polished screens or detailed UI work, because that level of polish communicates confidence you simply _don’t_ have yet. And honestly, most of those details aren’t even needed this early.

*High fidelity signals:*  
**“I know what this is. I’m confident. This is close to final.”**

*Low fidelity signals:* 
**“We’re exploring. It’s open to interpretation. This can change. We encourage you to participate”**

As you learn more and the solution becomes clearer, _then_ you start increasing fidelity. You raise the resolution of the design when you have a higher-resolution understanding of the problem and the solution.

Fidelity should rise with your confidence. If you show a high-fidelity mockup, it should mean you have a high-fidelity understanding. In other words:

**The resolution of the design should match the resolution of your clarity.**
  

## What is a Golden Flow?

![Sample Journey](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/neileverette/Golden-Flows/main/Sample-journey.png)
  
Sometime referenced as a *Critical User Journey*, or *CJU*, **a golden flow is the primary journey** a user takes to accomplish their core goal—the 80% path your product must get right before anything else matters. It’s the backbone of the experience. Everything else is secondary until this is understood and validated.

Golden flows ignore edge cases, surface detail, and optional paths. They deliberately strip the experience down to the sequence that delivers value. As understanding increases, the flow can be explored at lower “altitudes” of detail.

### An example we can all understand (travel site)

Consider the last time you traveled. I bet your journey was similar to this:
1. Search for flights - enter your criteria
2. Evaluate options - see options, consider price vs convenience
3. Select flight - pick the perfect fare
4. Choose options - your add-ons
5. Review - read it back and double dog check it
6. Purchase - commitment
7. Confirmation - validate it went through

Look familar? Yep, we can map that story. Each step later can have its own deep-dive into its own Golden Flow.

## Why Focusing on the Golden Flow Works

Golden flows shift attention from **features** to **purpose**. By anchoring the team on the core journey, they:
- Reduce ambiguity early in the process
- Exposes incorrect assumptions quickly
- Prevents distraction from secondary details and side-quests
- Gives cross-functional groups a visual shared reference
- Ensures micro-details don’t get cloud progress
- Support rapid iteration and early conceptual testing

Most importantly, they help teams avoid jumping into details of UI too early—a common trap where fidelity misrepresents how much is actually understood.

## The Issues With Fidelity

Designers will often start with high-fidelity, component screens because modern design systems make it a little too easy. But this can create issues in early stage work:

- Stakeholders can get distracted on detail, or "side quests"
- Early assumptions can become locked in - difficult to back out of
- The design appear more stated intent, than "open-canvas", collaborative work
- Teams spend time perfecting details that aren't core at the moment
- The fidelity does not accurately match the maturity of thinking


Golden Flow Design replaces this with work that looks intentionally rough—like draft models—signaling exploration, not commitment.

### Consider Two Toolkits

**Low-Fidelity Toolkit - early stage**
- Rough frames
- Implied structure
- Minimal text
- Blocked/Greeked details
- Ideal for early discovery
- Mural is great at this, as it forces a crude level of detail.

**UI Component Toolkit**
- Used only after the flow is validated
- Appropriate for refinement and delivery
- Figma is the tool of choice

## The Method in Practice

Golden Flow Design is built on **fast, small learning loops**, each increasing resolution only when understanding matures.

Below are steps I do on almost any project:

### Rewrite the Requirements in Your Own Words

Before designing anything, restate the requirements in a way that makes sense to you. Writing, if if prompting an assistant to turn thoughts into narrative is a powerful tool. Writing forces clarity, exposes missing pieces, and ensures you aren’t inheriting assumptions blindly.

### Envision the Future State with a PRFAQ

Write a short “press release” and FAQ describing the ideal outcome at launch.

This helps the team align on:
- Who the customer is
- Why the solution matters
- The business impact
- How it would be positioned if it shipped

It gives everyone a clear picture of the **destination** before exploring the **path**.

### 1. Start with a Short Narrative

- Describe the user, their situation, their goal, and the outcome they’re trying to achieve.
- This replaces missing requirements and forces early clarity.
- Block out the steps in simple boxes–like a flow
- Add minimal detail where needed. Imply what might be there.

  

### 2. Map the Core Steps
- Lay out the essential sequence from start to completion.
- Keep it broad—this is shaping logic, not UI.

  

### 3. Create Minimal Frames
- Turn the steps into rough wireframes.
- Highlight only what matters; Greek or block everything else.
- Use implied elements to avoid unnecessary detail that could distract stakeholders.

### 4. Run Multiple Iterations. Refine. Repeat
- Share early and often with PMs, SMEs, engineers, and users.
- Each loop reveals gaps and misunderstandings.
- Low-fidelity makes changes cheap, which makes learning fast.

 

### 5. Increase Fidelity Gradually
- Move to mid-fidelity only when the flow works.
- Add in the details. Gain in resolution
- Move to high fidelity only after the concept is validated.

## Fidelity Progression

### Stages of fidelity ( and understanding )

| Fidelity | Purpose              | Output                           | When to Use        |
|---------|-----------------------|----------------------------------|---------------------|
| Low     | Explore & align       | Sketches, simple wires           | Early discovery     |
| Mid     | Structure & validate  | Structured wires, clickable flows| After alignment     |
| High    | Finalize & deliver    | Polished UI, prototypes          | After validation    |

## Example: Site Reliability Engineer

A high-altitude golden flow for an SRE might look like:

A Site Reliability Engineer’s golden flow starts when monitoring tools surface an incident. They quickly diagnose the root cause, apply a fix, and verify that systems are stable before closing the loop.

1. Detect an issue
2. Identify the cause
3. Find the fix
4. Remediate
5. Confirm stability

- A narrative gives context.
- A simple diagram lays out the steps.
- A rough storyboard visualizes what information is needed and when.
- Iterating through these layers builds understanding long before any UI is polished.

## Why This Accelerates Discovery

Teams using Golden Flow Design tend to:

- Align faster
- Test assumptions earlier
- Reduce redesign and rework
- Avoid wasted time on premature detail
- Stay focused on outcomes
- Produce clearer user journeys
- Build confidence through repeated learning

This method treats design as **iterative knowledge-building**: start with the bones, test assumptions, and strengthen the solution through rapid feedback loops.

It values **progress over perfection**—especially in early ambiguity.

## Make it Habitual

Golden Flow Design isn’t a deliverable—it’s process and approach to learning
At the beginning of every new project, ask:

**What is the golden flow?**

**If your team can answer it, you’re ready to move.**
If they can’t, this process will help you find the clarity you need.

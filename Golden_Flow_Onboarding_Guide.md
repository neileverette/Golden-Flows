**We’ve all been there.** A new project lands in your lap—big, ambitious, and lacking clarity. It's early stage, Day 0 so maybe the requirements are there, or the idea vague. Many times, they aren't documented, or maybe not written in a clear way - maybe more like a list of notes. 
The technical domain feels dense, maybe even cryptic, and nothing seems to quite clicks, and you're struggling to put the pieces together, to get a mental model. And to add to that, 
maybe the stakeholders don’t share the same picture—or worse, they disagree and have competing objectives. Yet you’re the one in the middle, expected to move things forward, and everyone is looking at you.
**Sounds familiar right? Yeah, I've been there.. a lot.**
The natural instinct is to open Figma and start mocking things up. Maybe pull a few older mockups, or just go directly into the Carbon toolkit and start creating pages. It feels productive, almost like an obligation. But at this stage, it’s the wrong tool. That's likely to add fuel to the confusion fire, or worse, lock you in a direction too early in the process.
This is the moment you shift the thinking from UI designer to product designer. What's the difference you might ask? Its huge - product design skills, the tools we use to model behavior include a broader set of tools and methods. Its that set of tools that include skills from content strategy, product management, business, technical, and user interface design. It looks at product in his holistic view, end-to-end solutioning with the understanding of the user, their task and the goal along a narraitve journey

At this stage of the process your task is understanding and team alignment on the clarity of idea, That shift seems small, but it’s crucial. It means focusing less on concrete screens and more on how things work, how users achieve their goals, and what the system really needs to be. You slow things down, dig into the details, explore the technology, learn the domain, and wade through the ambiguity. Your job is to bring shape to the chaos.

Why this article exists - what's its "job to be done"?

This article is about that early-stage approach—how to use your product design skills to clarify the problem space, align stakeholders, and guide everyone toward a shared understanding. You’re not just designing a solution; you’re helping the team see the problem clearly enough to build the right thing together.

  

**Golden Flow Design offers an alternative path.**

  

Golden Flow Design is a simple, low-fidelity, customer-journey method that helps teams see the problem clearly, test assumptions, and align early—long before committing to detailed UI work. Instead of jumping into interface design, you focus on the experience: the steps a user takes, the intent behind each moment, and how the system supports that flow.

  

It’s both a learning process and an alignment process. You use your design skills to visualize the journey, not to polish mockups. By making to learn—not making to ship—you build understanding, uncover gaps, and guide the team toward clarity.

  

This process is intentionally rough early on because the goal isn’t finalization—it’s ***a learning and alignment process***.

  

**Fidelity should follow the understanding, not the other way around.**

## What is a Golden Flow?

![Sample Journey](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/neileverette/Golden-Flows/main/Sample-journey.png)

  

Sometime referenced as a *Critical User Journey*, or *CJU*, **a golden flow is the primary journey** a user takes to accomplish their core goal—the 80% path your product must get right before anything else matters. It’s the backbone of the experience. Everything else is secondary until this is understood and validated.

  

Golden flows ignore edge cases, surface detail, and optional paths. They deliberately strip the experience down to the sequence that delivers value. As understanding increases, the flow can be explored at lower “altitudes” of detail.

  
  

### An example we can all understand (travel site)

Consider the last time you traveled. I bet your journey was similar to this:

  

1. Search for flights - enter your criteria

2. Evaluate options - see options, consider price vs convenience

3. Select flight - pick the perfect fare

4. Choose options - your add-ons

5. Review - read it back and double dog check it

6. Purchase - commitment

7. Confirmation - validate it went through

Sound familiar? Yep, we can map that. Each step later can have its own deep-dive into its own Golden Flow.

## Why Focusing on the Golden Flow Works

Golden flows shift attention from **features** to **purpose**. By anchoring the team on the core journey, they:

  

- Reduce ambiguity early in the process

- Exposes incorrect assumptions quickly

- Prevents distraction from secondary details and side-quests

- Gives cross-functional groups a visual shared reference

- Ensures micro-details don’t get cloud progress

- Support rapid iteration and early conceptual testing

  

Most importantly, they help teams avoid jumping into details of UI too early—a common trap where fidelity misrepresents how much is actually understood.

## The Real Problem: Fidelity Too Early

Designers will often start with high-fidelity, component screens because modern design systems make it a little too easy. But this can create issues in early stage work:

  

- Stakeholders can get distracted on detail, or "side quests"

- Early assumptions can become locked in - difficult to back out of

- The design appear more stated intent, than "open-canvas", collaborative work

- Teams spend time perfecting details that aren't core at the moment

- The fidelity does not accurately match the maturity of thinking

  

Golden Flow Design replaces this with work that looks intentionally rough—like draft models—signaling exploration, not commitment.

### Consider Two Toolkits

  

**Low-Fidelity Toolkit - early stage**

- Rough frames

- Implied structure

- Minimal text

- Blocked/Greeked details

- Ideal for early discovery

- Mural is great at this, as it forces a crude level of detail.

  

**UI Component Toolkit**

- Used only after the flow is validated

- Appropriate for refinement and delivery

- Figma is the tool of choice

## The Method in Practice

Golden Flow Design is built on **fast, small learning loops**, each increasing resolution only when understanding matures.

  

Below is the full method with the two optional steps integrated:

  

### 0.Rewrite the Requirements in Your Own Words

Before designing anything, restate the requirements in a way that makes sense to you.

This forces clarity, exposes missing pieces, and ensures you aren’t inheriting assumptions blindly.

  

### 0.5. Envision the Future State with a PRFAQ

Write a short “press release” and FAQ describing the ideal outcome at launch.

This helps the team align on:

  

- Who the customer is

- Why the solution matters

- The business impact

- How it would be positioned if it shipped

  

It gives everyone a clear picture of the **destination** before exploring the **path**.

  

### 1. Start with a Short Narrative

- Describe the user, their situation, their goal, and the outcome they’re trying to achieve.

- This replaces missing requirements and forces early clarity.

  

### 2. Map the Core Steps

- Lay out the essential sequence from start to completion.

- Keep it broad—this is shaping logic, not UI.

  

### 3. Create Minimal Frames

- Turn the steps into rough wireframes.

- Highlight only what matters; Greek or block everything else.

- Use implied elements to avoid unnecessary detail that could distract stakeholders.

  

### 4. Run Micro-Iterations

- Share early and often with PMs, SMEs, engineers, and users.

- Each loop reveals gaps and misunderstandings.

- Low-fidelity makes changes cheap, which makes learning fast.

  

### 5. Increase Fidelity Gradually

- Move to mid-fidelity only when the flow works.

- Move to high fidelity only after the concept is validated.

## Fidelity Progression

  

| Fidelity | Purpose | Output | When to Use |

|-----------|----------|---------|--------------|

| Low | Explore & align | Sketches, simple wires | Early discovery |

| Mid | Structure & validate | Structured wires, clickable flows | After alignment |

| High | Finalize & deliver | Polished UI, prototypes | After validation |

## Example: Site Reliability Engineer

  

A high-altitude golden flow for an SRE might look like:

  

A Site Reliability Engineer’s golden flow starts when monitoring tools surface an incident. They quickly diagnose the root cause, apply a fix, and verify that systems are stable before closing the loop.

  

1. Detect an issue

2. Identify the cause

3. Find the fix

4. Remediate

5. Confirm stability

  

- A narrative gives context.

- A simple diagram lays out the steps.

- A rough storyboard visualizes what information is needed and when.

- Iterating through these layers builds understanding long before any UI is polished.

## Why This Accelerates Discovery

Teams using Golden Flow Design tend to:

  

- Align faster

- Test assumptions earlier

- Reduce redesign and rework

- Avoid wasted time on premature detail

- Stay focused on outcomes

- Produce clearer user journeys

- Build confidence through repeated learning

This method treats design as **iterative knowledge-building**: start with the bones, test assumptions, and strengthen the solution through rapid feedback loops.

  

It values **progress over perfection**—especially in early ambiguity.

## Make it Habitual

Golden Flow Design isn’t a deliverable—it’s process and approach to learning.

At the beginning of every new project, ask:

  

**What is the golden flow?**

If your team can answer it, you’re ready to move.

If they can’t, this process will help you find the clarity you need.
